# 💧 Droplet Impact Simulation

## 📌 Overview

This project presents a physics-based simulation of droplet impact on solid surfaces, focusing on transient spreading dynamics governed by inertial, capillary, and viscous forces.
The goal is to bridge analytical fluid mechanics with computational visualisation.

## 🧪 Physics Model

The simulation is based on simplified governing principles:

* Free-fall velocity:
  v = √(2gH)

* Weber number:
  We = ρv²D / σ

* Maximum spreading law:
  Dₘₐₓ ∝ We^(1/4)

* Early-time spreading:
  R(t) ~ √(3R₀Vt)

* Post-impact recoil modelled using exponential decay

## ⚙️ Methodology

1. Compute impact velocity from release height
2. Detect impact time analytically
3. Apply the early-time spreading law
4. Introduce saturation and recoil
5. Visualise deformation using dynamic geometry
